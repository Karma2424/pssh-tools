**Tools to generate PSSH Data and PSSH Box**

For dealing with multi-drm using common encryption (cenc) we may need to generate pssh data and/or pssh box to use in our workflow. This tools helpful to easily provide the base64 pssh data for Widevine and PlayReady.

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install pssh-tools
```

## Supported PSSH

Currently we're only focus on Widevine and PlayReady but we will support more in the future.
